## ðŸ“˜ About

This project is a simulation of Braitenberg Vehicles, inspired by the book  
**"Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology"** by Valentino Braitenberg (MIT Press, 1984).  
It visualizes simple autonomous agents with basic sensor-actuator connections.

> Note: This project contains **original code and interpretation** of ideas from the book, not any copied content.
