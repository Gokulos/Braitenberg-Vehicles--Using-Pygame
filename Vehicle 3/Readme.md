Variable Inhibition set to True and Cross_connection set to False â€“ It behaves like 
showing affection (towards the source and stops). and if Cross_connection is set to 
True, it behaves as if showing fear (moving away from the source)

The speed is subtracted from 1 to demonstrate inhibition. This means 
that if the vehicle is near the source, the distance will be small, 
resulting in a high sensor signal and therefore a high speed value. 
Since the speed is a value between 0 and 1, subtracting it from 1 
causes the vehicle to slow down or stop when it is close to the source.
